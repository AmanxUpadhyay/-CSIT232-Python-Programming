# Suppose you are given the following list of strings:
# L = ['aabaabac', 'cabaabca', 'aaabbcba', 'aabacbab', 'acababba']
# Patterns like this show up in many places, including DNA sequencing. The user has a string of their own with only some letters filled in and the rest as asterisks. An example is a**a****. The user would like to know which of the strings in the list fit with their pattern.
# In the example just given, the matching strings are the first and fourth. One way to solve this problem is to create a dictionary whose keys are the indices in the userâ€™s string of the non-asterisk characters and whose values are those characters. Write a program implementing this approach (or some other approach) to find the strings that match a user-entered string.
